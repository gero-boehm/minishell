- these chars form a boundary for variables " !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^`{|}~"
  - variable boundaries within variable names cause error in export and unset. except in export one or more minuses "-" cause usage to be printed "export: usage: export [-nf] [name[=value] ...] or export -p"

- export and unset can have multiple variables defined at the same time
- unset does nothing without args
